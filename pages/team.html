						Inventor site, and he is the lead author of App Inventor: Create
						your own Android Apps, along with App Inventor creators Hal
						Abelson, Ellen Spertus and Liz Looney. He is also a co-author of
						an on-line course and professional development materials for the
						new Computational Thinking Advanced Placement (AP) course for US
						High Schools at <a href="//mobile-csp.org">mobile csp</a>. Wolber
						recently completed a sabbatical at MIT where he contributed to the
						release of App Inventor 2. USF students and he led the development of the App Inventor Community Gallery which is now integrated in the App Inventor tool. Wolber and the Democratize Computing Lab are funded by the W.M. Keck Foundation
