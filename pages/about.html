			<p>AppInventor.org is a site for learning and teaching how to
				program mobile apps with MIT's App Inventor. These tutorials are
				refined versions of the tutorials that have been on the Google and
				MIT App Inventor sites from App Inventor's inception-- thousands of
				beginners have used them to learn programming and learn App
				Inventor.</p>

			<p>
				This site is also designed for use by teachers. The teaching
				materials here have been used as a basis for numerous middle school,
				high school, and college courses. The <a href="/course-in-a-box2">course-in-a-box</a>,
				which is based on Wolber's USF courses, provides structure and
				material to get a new course up and running within days.
			</p>

			<p>Your guide in these pursuits is David Wolber, Professor of
				Computer Science at the University of San Francisco. Wolber began
				teaching App Inventor as part of Google's 2009 pilot program and has
				taught more App Inventor courses and workshops than any human alive.
				His USF course, "Computing, Mobile Apps, and the Web", has served as
				a model for teaching non-CS-majors and interesting them in
				computing. The apps created by his students -- mostly humanities and
				business majors with no prior programming experience -- have been
				chronicled in several articles shown below.</p>

			<p>In 2010 Wolber received a grant from Google to work with the
				App Inventor team and author the original advanced tutorials that
				appear on the App Inventor site.</p>
			<p>
				In 2011, Wolber's book <a href="/book">App Inventor: Create your
					own Android apps</a> was published by O'Reilly. In this book, Wolber
				teams with MIT Professor and App Inventor creator Hal Abelson as
				well as Ellen Spertus and Liz Looney from the App Inventor team.
				This book is available in paperback at Amazon and on-line for free
				here at appinventor.org.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2012, Wolber was part of a collaborative project awarded a <a
					href="http://appinventorblog.com/2012/08/27/national-science-foundation-grant-for-teaching-app-inventor">National
					Science Foundation TUES grant</a> (Transforming Undergraduate Education
				in STEM). The grant team, including USF, MIT (Abelson), Wellesley
				(Franklyn Turbak), UMass-Lowell (Fred Martin), and Trinity College
				(Ralph Morelli), is tasked with developing materials for teaching
				mobile programming to beginners.
			</p>

			<p>In 2013, Wolber was awarded a Keck Foundation grant to
				initiate the Democratize Computing Lab at USF</p>
			<p>
				In 2014, Wolber and his co-authors published an App Inventor 2
				version of <a href="/book2">App Inventor: Create your own
					Android apps</a>
